    date: "Mar 2025",
    description:
      "This project focuses on detecting anomalies in a highly imbalanced fraud dataset using unsupervised techniques. It involves thorough exploratory data analysis and visualization to understand data distributions and identify outlier behavior. Models such as Isolation Forest and Autoencoders are employed to flag potential fraudulent activities. Evaluation metrics like confusion matrices and classification reports are used to assess detection performance. The project demonstrates a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and insightful visualization.",
